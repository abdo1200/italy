                     <p> Italy , officially the Italian Republic  Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of 301,338 km2 (116,347 sq mi) and has a largely temperate seasonal and Mediterranean climate. With around 61 million inhabitants it is the fourth most populous EU member state.

                     Since classical times, ancient Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Greeks established settlements in the south of Italy, with Etruscans and Celts inhabiting the centre and the north of Italy respectively and various ancient Italian tribes and Italic peoples dispersed throughout the Italian peninsula and insular Italy. The Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom, which eventually became a republic that conquered and assimilated its neighbors. Ultimately the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean basin and became the leading cultural, political and religious centre of Western civilisation. The legacy of the Roman Empire is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of civilian law, republican governments, Christianity and the Latin script.

                          <h1>Top Five Things You Should Know Befor Visiting Italy :</h1>
                    </div>
                          <h3>1. There are two independent city-states within Italian borders</h3>
                          <p>Most people know that Vatican City, the world’s smallest independent state, is wholly inside the borders of Rome. Far fewer people realize that Italy contains yet another independent city-state – San Marino. The “Most Serene Republic of San Marino” is on the border between the regions of Emilia-Romagna and Le Marche and it’s a little more than 24 miles (61kms) square. Both the Vatican and San Marino use the euro as their currency, and neither has any sort of border or passport control, though in San Marino you can go to the tourist information office to buy a souvenir passport stamp</p>
                        
                        
                        
                          <h3>2. Hotels need your passport when you check in. </h3>
                          <p>We’re all concerned about identity theft, so when the concierge at your hotel in Italy asks for your passport and then says they may need to keep it overnight, you might get a little jumpy. Don’t fret. It’s perfectly fine. Italian law requires all accommodation to register guests with local police. They’ll return your passport the following morning, if not before.</p>
                        
                          
                          
                          <h3>3. The waiter isn’t ignoring you.</h3>
                          <p>In Italy, when you sit down to a meal in a restaurant the assumption is that the table is yours until you’re done. They are not trying to get you to finish quickly so they can seat another party. Dining is a sacred social activity, and dinner can take several hours, so they are absolutely not going to rush you. If you’re not aware of that, it’s going to seem like the waiter is deliberating ignoring the fact that you’re clearly done with your meal and are ready for your bill. You are not being ignored. You are being allowed the freedom to be social as long as you like. The waiter will bring the check only when prompted. A simple, “Il conto, per favore,” will do</p>
                        
                        
                          <h3>4. “Italian food” doesn’t exist.</h3>
                          <p>Italy is made up of 20 regions, each with its own unique culinary identity and traditions. For instance, pizza comes from Naples, and though you can now get a pizza in just about every town throughout Italy, you shouldn’t count on it being sublime everywhere. Ordering pizza in Venice also means you’re missing out on typical Venetian dishes that you may never have heard of before and won’t find anywhere else. The more you learn about regional specialties, what’s in season when, and what ingredients are local, the better your eating experience will be no matter where you go in Italy.</p>
                        
                          <h3>5. There’s history in Italy that’s more ancient than ancient Rome.</h3>
                          <p>You know you’ve got ancient Roman ruins on your must-see list in Rome, not to mention other parts of Italy, but have you heard of the Etruscans? They’re a civilization about which little is known (still) that dominated much of what is now central Italy from about 750-500 BCE. They were eventually assimilated by the ancient Romans. There are also some incredibly well-preserved ancient Greek ruins in Italy, including at Peastum in Campania and in Sicily near Agrigento. Remember that even the ancient Romans thought Greek relics were ancient; that’ll give you an idea of just how old those Greek temples are.</p>
